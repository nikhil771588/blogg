        <h1>Database Recovery Techniques</h1>
        <p>Database recovery techniques ensure that data remains consistent and available even after failures. Below are some key techniques:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Log-Based Recovery</h2>
        <p>Uses transaction logs to restore data after crashes.</p>
        <p>Log-based recovery is a technique used in database management systems (DBMS) to ensure data integrity and consistency after a failure.<br> This method relies on maintaining a log file that records all database transactions before they are committed. In case of a crash or failure, the system uses these logs to restore the database to a consistent state.

            <h2>  <b>1. Types of Logging in DBMS</b><br></h2>
            Log-based recovery involves storing logs that help in rolling back uncommitted transactions or redoing committed ones. The common types of logging include:<br>
            
            Redo Logging (Deferred Update)<br>
            
            Changes are recorded in the log before they are written to the database.<br>
            
            Transactions are not applied to the database until they are fully committed.<br>
            
            Recovery process involves redoing committed transactions from the log.<br>
            
            Undo Logging (Immediate Update)<br>
            
            Database updates occur immediately, but logs allow for rolling back changes if needed.<br>
            
            Uncommitted transactions can be undone using the recorded log entries.<br>
            
            Undo/Redo Logging (Combination Approach)<br>
            
            Logs contain both undo and redo information.<br>
            
            Allows for flexible recovery by rolling back uncommitted transactions and reapplying committed ones.<br>
            
            <h2> 2. Log-Based Recovery Process </h2>
            The recovery process involves two main steps:<br>
            
            a) Undo Phase<br>
            Used to roll back uncommitted transactions.<br>
            
            Transactions that started but were not completed before the crash are undone using the log.<br>
            
            b) Redo Phase<br>
            Used to reapply committed transactions.<br>
            
            Ensures that all committed transactions are reflected in the database.<br>
            
        <b> 3. Checkpointing in Log-Based Recovery<br></b>
            To optimize recovery, checkpoints are periodically created in the log. A checkpoint saves the current state of the database, reducing the amount of log that needs to be processed during recovery.<br>
            
            Consistent Checkpointing: Ensures that all transactions before a checkpoint are completed.<br>
            
            Fuzzy Checkpointing: Allows transactions to be active during checkpoint creation.<br>
            
          <b> 4. Advantages of Log-Based Recovery<br></b>
            Ensures data consistency even after system failures.<br>
            
            Supports automatic recovery with minimal manual intervention.<br>
            
            Reduces data loss by recording every transaction.<br>
            
            Works efficiently with concurrent transactions.<br>

            <b>  5. Limitations of Log-Based Recovery<br></b>
            Storage overhead: Logs require additional storage space.<br>
            
            Performance impact: Writing logs before committing transactions may slow down operations.<br>
            
            Complex recovery: Managing redo and undo processes can be complex in large-scale systems.<br>
